Today I was invited to give a seminar at the Johann Radon Institute for Computational and Applied Mathematics ([RICAM](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/ricam/)) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, in the Computational Methods for PDEs group. I had the opportunity to present our work on reduced-order modelling and recent hybridisation of the PGD with the Finite Element Neural Network Interpolation (FENNI) framework [@daby-seesaramFiniteElementNeural2024;@skardovaFiniteElementNeural2024].

The shown exemples used our open-source code, [NeuROM](https://pypi.org/project/NeuROM-Py/)
