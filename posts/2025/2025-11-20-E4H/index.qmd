Today I had the pleasure to present my (collaborative) work on building a digital twin of the human lungs through interpretable NN-PGD [@daby-seesaramFiniteElementNeural2025] and shape registration from CT-scans at the annual E4H forum @ IP Paris.

The slides accessible [here](https://alexandredabyseesaram.github.io/E4H_2025/#/title-slide).
