	abstract = {This paper presents a tensor decomposition (TD) based reduced-order model of the hierarchical deep-learning neural networks (HiDeNN). The proposed HiDeNN-TD method keeps advantages of both HiDeNN and TD methods. The automatic mesh adaptivity makes the HiDeNN-TD more accurate than the finite element method (FEM) and conventional proper generalized decomposition (PGD) and TD, using a fraction of the FEM degrees of freedom. This work focuses on the theoretical foundation of the method. Hence, the accuracy and convergence of the method have been studied theoretically and numerically, with a comparison to different methods, including FEM, PGD, TD, HiDeNN and Deep Neural Networks. In addition, we have theoretically shown that the PGD/TD converges to FEM at increasing modes, and the PGD/TD solution error is a summation of the mesh discretization error and the mode reduction error. The proposed HiDeNN-TD shows a high accuracy with orders of magnitude fewer degrees of freedom than FEM, and hence a high potential to achieve fast computations with a high level of accuracy for large-size engineering and scientific problems. As a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, we propose a highly efficient solution strategy called HiDeNN-PGD. Although the solution is less accurate than HiDeNN-TD, HiDeNN-PGD still provides a higher accuracy than PGD/TD and FEM with only a small amount of additional cost to PGD.},

All the data must be taken into account to find the basis vectors. These methods are not convenient for any improvement of the basis vectors when new data are added into the data base. We consider the data as a state evolution and we propose an incremental algorithm to build basis functions for the decomposition of this state evolution. The proposed algorithm is based on the APHR method (A Priori Hyper-Reduction method). This is an adaptive strategy to build reduced order model when the state evolution is implicitely defined by non-linear governing equations. In case of known state evolutions the APHR method is an incremental Karhunen-Loève decomposition. This approach is very convenient to expand the subspace spanned by the basis functions. In the first part of the present paper the main concepts related to the “a priori” model reduction technique are revisited, as a previous task to its application in the cases considered in the next sections.},

This paper presents a framework of the nonlinear finite element based on HiDeNN approximation (nonlinear HiDeNN-FEM). This is enabled by three basic building blocks employing structured deep neural networks: (1) A partial derivative operator block that performs the differentiation of the shape functions with respect to the element coordinates, (2) An r-adaptivity block that improves the local and global convergence properties and (3) A materials derivative block that evaluates the material derivatives of the shape function. While these building blocks can be applied to any element, specific implementations are presented in 1D and 2D to illustrate the application of the deep learning neural network. Two-step optimization schemes are further developed to allow for the capabilities of r-adaptivity and easy integration with any existing FE solver. Numerical examples of 2D and 3D demonstrate that the proposed nonlinear HiDeNN-FEM with r-adaptivity provides much higher accuracy than regular FEM. It also significantly reduces element distortion and suppresses the hourglass mode.},

The polynomial model form of Operator Inference is sufficiently expressive to cover a wide range of nonlinear dynamics found in fluid mechanics and other fields of science and engineering, while still providing efficient reduced model computations. The learning steps of Operator Inference are rooted in classical projection-based model reduction; thus, some of the rich theory of model reduction can be applied to models learned with Operator Inference. This connection to projection-based model reduction theory offers a pathway toward deriving error estimates and gaining insights to improve predictions. Furthermore, through formulations of Operator Inference that preserve Hamiltonian and other structures, important physical properties such as energy conservation can be guaranteed in the predictions of the reduced model beyond the training horizon. This review illustrates key computational steps of Operator Inference through a large-scale combustion example.},

	abstract = {We propose the Convolution Hierarchical Deep-learning Neural Network (C-HiDeNN) that can be tuned to have superior accuracy, higher smoothness, and faster convergence rates like higher order finite element methods (FEM) while using only linear element’s degrees of freedom. This is based on our newly developed convolution interpolation theory (Lu et al. in Comput Mech, 2023) and this article focuses on the deep-learning interpretation of C-HiDeNN with graphics processing unit (GPU) programming using JAX library in Python. Instead of increasing the degrees of freedom like higher order FEM, C-HiDeNN takes advantage of neighboring elements to construct the so-called convolution patch functions. The computational overhead of C-HiDeNN is reduced by GPU programming and the total solution time is brought down to the same order as commercial FEM software running on a CPU, however, with orders of magnitude better accuracy and faster convergence rates. C-HiDeNN is locking-free regardless of element types (even with 3-node triangular elements or 4-node tetrahedral elements). C-HiDeNN is also capable of r-h-p-mesh adaptivity like its predecessor HiDeNN (Zhang et al. in Comput Mech 67:207–230, 2021) with additional “a” (dilation parameter) adaptivity that stems from the convolution patch function and “p” adaptivity with higher accuracy and with the same degrees of freedom as that of the linear finite elements. C-HiDeNN potentially has myriad future applications in multiscale analysis, additive and advanced manufacturing process simulations, and high-resolution topology optimization. Details on these applications can be found in the companion papers (Lu et al. 2023; Saha et al. in Comput Mech, 2023; Li et al. in Comput Mech, 2023) published in this special issue.},

Basically, this non-linear solver assumes a space–time separated representation presaging nowadays PGD strategies. We extend this family of solvers to frictional engineering applications with reduced subspaces and no prior knowledge about the solution (contrary to a posteriori model reduction techniques). Hereinafter, a hybrid a priori/a posteriori LATIN-PGD formulation for frictional contact problems is proposed. Indeed, the suggested algorithm may or may not start with an initial guess of the reduced basis and is able to enrich the basis in order to reach a given level of accuracy. Moreover, it provides progressively the solution of the considered problem into a quasi-optimal space–time separated form compared to the singular value decomposition (SVD). Some examples are provided in order to illustrate the efficiency and quasi-optimality of the proposed a priori reduced basis LATIN solver.},

	abstract = {Hierarchical tensors can be regarded as a generalisation, preserving many crucial features, of the singular value decomposition to higher-order tensors. For a given tensor product space, a recursive decomposition of the set of coordinates into a dimension tree gives a hierarchy of nested subspaces and corresponding nested bases. The dimensions of these subspaces yield a notion of multilinear rank. This rank tuple, as well as quasi-optimal low-rank approximations by rank truncation, can be obtained by a hierarchical singular value decomposition. For fixed multilinear ranks, the storage and operation complexity of these hierarchical representations scale only linearly in the order of the tensor. As in the matrix case, the set of hierarchical tensors of a given multilinear rank is not a convex set, but forms an open smooth manifold. A number of techniques for the computation of hierarchical low-rank approximations have been developed, including local optimisation techniques on Riemannian manifolds as well as truncated iteration methods, which can be applied for solving high-dimensional partial differential equations. This article gives a survey of these developments. We also discuss applications to problems in uncertainty quantification, to the solution of the electronic Schrödinger equation in the strongly correlated regime, and to the computation of metastable states in molecular dynamics.},

In contrast to the canonical r-term representation (CANDECOMP, PARAFAC), these new formats provide stable representations, while the amount of required data is only slightly larger. The tensor train (TT) format [SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 33 (2011), pp. 2295–2317], a simple special case of the hierarchical Tucker format [J. Fourier Anal. Appl., 5 (2009), p. 706], is a useful prototype for practical low-rank tensor representation. In this article, we show how optimization tasks can be treated in the TT format by a generalization of the well-known alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm and by a modified approach (MALS) that enables dynamical rank adaptation. A formulation of the component equations in terms of so-called retraction operators helps to show that many structural properties of the original problems transfer to the micro-iterations, giving what is to our knowledge the first stable generic algorithm for the treatment of optimization tasks in the tensor format. For the examples of linear equations and eigenvalue equations, we derive concrete working equations for the micro-iteration steps; numerical examples confirm the theoretical results concerning the stability of the TT decomposition and of ALS and MALS but also show that in some cases, high TT ranks are required during the iterative approximation of low-rank tensors, showing some potential of improvement.},

	abstract = {Over the past years, model reduction techniques have become a necessary path for the reduction of computational requirements in the numerical simulation of complex models. A family of a priori model reduction techniques, called Proper Generalized Decomposition (PGD) methods, are receiving a growing interest. These methods rely on the a priori construction of separated variables representations of the solution of models deﬁned in tensor product spaces. They can be interpreted as generalizations of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) for the a priori construction of such separated representations. In this paper, we introduce and study different deﬁnitions of PGD for the solution of time-dependent partial differential equations. We review classical deﬁnitions of PGD based on Galerkin or Minimal Residual formulations and we propose and discuss several improvements for these classical deﬁnitions. We give an interpretation of optimal decompositions as the solution of pseudo-eigenproblems. We also introduce a new deﬁnition of PGD, called Minimax PGD, which can be interpreted as a Petrov–Galerkin model reduction technique, where test and trial reduced basis functions are related by an adjoint problem. This new deﬁnition improves convergence properties of separated representations with respect to a chosen metric. It coincides with a classical POD for degenerate time-dependent partial differential equations. For the numerical construction of each PGD, we propose algorithms inspired from the solution of eigenproblems. Several numerical examples illustrate and compare the different deﬁnitions of PGD on transient advection–diffusion–reaction equations.},

	abstract = {Simulation-based engineering usually needs the construction of computational vademecum to take into account the multiparametric aspect. One example concerns the optimization and inverse identification problems encountered in welding processes. This paper presents a nonintrusive a posteriori strategy for constructing quasi-optimal space-time computational vademecum using the higher-order proper generalized decomposition method. Contrary to conventional tensor decomposition methods, based on full grids (eg, parallel factor analysis/higher-order singular value decomposition), the proposed method is adapted to sparse grids, which allows an efficient adaptive sampling in the multidimensional parameter space. In addition, a residual-based accelerator is proposed to accelerate the higher-order proper generalized decomposition procedure for the optimal aspect of computational vademecum. Based on a simplified welding model, different examples of computational vademecum of dimension up to 6, taking into account both geometry and material parameters, are presented. These vademecums lead to real-time parametric solutions and can serve as handbook for engineers to deal with optimization, identification, or other problems related to repetitive task.},

A hybrid approach is proposed to solve the nonlinear behaviour in the temporal domain, while the mechanical equilibrium is solved using a frequency strategy coupled with model-order reduction methods. In order to employ the fast Fourier transform (FFT) robustly for the transient regime, artificial numerical damping is used. The reduced-order hybrid temporal-frequency approach is investigated for two- and three-dimensional applications; it appears as a robust and proficient technique to simulate structures under transient dynamic loadings until failure.},

	abstract = {Computational assistance gains increasing importance in the ﬁeld of medical surgery. As an example, in the present work, we look at functional endoscopic sinus surgery. Simulations for surgery training programs or online support during surgeries require simulation tools which are characterized by a preferably short simulation time (real time) and a high degree of accuracy. The nonlinear ﬁnite element method is most suitable to yield qualitatively and quantitatively reliable results. The problem is, however, to achieve such results in real time. One possibility to reach both, short computational time and high accuracy, is to combine model reduction and ﬁnite element techniques. Therefore, in this paper, various projection-based model reduction methods are discussed and compared with respect to their possible application in biomechanics. The modal basis, the load-dependent Ritz and the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method were used to reduce the model of a cube under compression considering different material nonlinearities and large deformations. The POD method led to the lowest errors in displacement and stress while providing the largest reduction in CPU time. Further, the inﬂuence of different POD parameters was investigated. According to this study, the snapshots upon which the POD is based had to agree as closely as possible with the original deformation of the reduced system. The POD method applied to the ﬁnite element model of an inferior turbinate led to an adequate accuracy for surgery simulations within less than one-third of the computational time of the unreduced ﬁnite element simulation.},

	abstract = {The lung vital function of providing oxygen to the body heavily relies on its mechanical behavior and the interaction with its complex environment. In particular, the large compliance and the porosity of the pulmonary tissue are critical for lung inflation and air inhalation, and the diaphragm, the pleura, the rib cage and intercostal muscles all play a role in delivering and controlling the breathing driving forces. In this paper, we introduce a novel poromechanical model of the lungs. The constitutive law is derived within a general poromechanics theory via the formulation of lung-specific assumptions, leading to a hyperelastic potential reproducing the volume response of the pulmonary mixture to a change of pressure. Moreover, physiological boundary conditions are formulated to account for the interaction of the lungs with their surroundings, including a following pressure and bilateral frictionless contact. A strategy is established to estimate the unloaded configuration from a given loaded state, with a particular focus on ensuring a positive porosity. Finally, we illustrate through several realistic examples the relevance of our model and its potential clinical applications.},

	abstract = {Tissue stiffening is a hallmark of fibrotic disorders but has traditionally been regarded as an outcome of fibrosis, not a contributing factor to pathogenesis. In this study, we show that fibrosis induced by bleomycin injury in the murine lung locally increases median tissue stiffness sixfold relative to normal lung parenchyma. Across this pathophysiological stiffness range, cultured lung fibroblasts transition from a surprisingly quiescent state to progressive increases in proliferation and matrix synthesis, accompanied by coordinated decreases in matrix proteolytic gene expression. Increasing matrix stiffness strongly suppresses fibroblast expression of COX-2 (cyclooxygenase-2) and synthesis of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), an autocrine inhibitor of fibrogenesis. Exogenous PGE2 or an agonist of the prostanoid EP2 receptor completely counteracts the proliferative and matrix synthetic effects caused by increased stiffness. Together, these results demonstrate a dominant role for normal tissue compliance, acting in part through autocrine PGE2, in maintaining fibroblast quiescence and reveal a feedback relationship between matrix stiffening, COX-2 suppression, and fibroblast activation that promotes and amplifies progressive fibrosis.},

  abstract = {This work deals with the question of the resolution of nonlinear problems for many different configurations in order to build a `virtual chart' of solutions. The targeted problems are three-dimensional structures driven by Chaboche-type elastic-viscoplastic constitutive laws. In this context, parametric analysis can lead to highly expensive computations when using a direct treatment. As an alternative, we present a technique based on the use of the time-space proper generalized decomposition in the framework of the LATIN method. To speed up the calculations in the parametrized context, we use the fact that at each iteration of the LATIN method, an approximation over the entire time-space domain is available. Then, a global reduced-order basis is generated, reused and eventually enriched, by treating, one-by-one, all the various parameter sets. The novelty of the current paper is to develop a strategy that uses the reduced-order basis for any new set of parameters as an initialization for the iterative procedure. The reduced-order basis, which has been built for a set of parameters, is reused to build a first approximation of the solution for another set of parameters. An error indicator allows adding new functions to the basis only if necessary. The gain of this strategy for studying the influence of material or loading variability reaches the order of 25 in the industrial examples that are presented.
