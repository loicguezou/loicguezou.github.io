  abstract = {Hierarchical tensors can be regarded as a generalisation, preserving many crucial features, of the singular value decomposition to higher-order tensors. For a given tensor product space, a recursive decomposition of the set of coordinates into a dimension tree gives a hierarchy of nested subspaces and corresponding nested bases. The dimensions of these subspaces yield a notion of multilinear rank. This rank tuple, as well as quasi-optimal low-rank approximations by rank truncation, can be obtained by a hierarchical singular value decomposition. For fixed multilinear ranks, the storage and operation complexity of these hierarchical representations scale only linearly in the order of the tensor. As in the matrix case, the set of hierarchical tensors of a given multilinear rank is not a convex set, but forms an open smooth manifold. A number of techniques for the computation of hierarchical low-rank approximations have been developed, including local optimisation techniques on Riemannian manifolds as well as truncated iteration methods, which can be applied for solving high-dimensional partial differential equations. This article gives a survey of these developments. We also discuss applications to problems in uncertainty quantification, to the solution of the electronic Schr{\"o}dinger equation in the strongly correlated regime, and to the computation of metastable states in molecular dynamics.},

A numerical experiment set confirms the framework's capability of handling various forward and inverse problems. In particular, the trained neural network generalises well for smooth problems, beating finite element solutions by some orders of magnitude.

In order to employ the fast Fourier transform (FFT) robustly for the transient regime, artificial numerical damping is used.

  abstract = {Hierarchical Deep-learning Neural Networks (HiDeNN) have recently been introduced to solve PDEs. Thanks to their mesh-based architecture, they have significantly fewer trainable parameters than fully connected neural networks. Moreover, these parameters are entirely interpretable. In this paper, we investigate the properties of HiDeNN and introduce several modifications to extend their capabilities. We describe in detail two approaches to shape function construction: the interpolation-layer-based approach and the reference-element-based approach. We investigate the performance of the framework, focusing on the impact of different loss functions on training efficiency and solution accuracy, as well as on the effect of numerical integration method used for loss evaluation. Additionally, we introduce the following two extensions to the existing HiDeNN framework: rh-adaptivity in higher dimension, which incorporates a Jacobian-based criterion to guide adaptive mesh refinement, and a multi-level training strategy, which leverages the network interpretability to efficiently transfer the learned weights across refinement levels. The capabilities of the proposed framework are demonstrated on linear elasticity problems in 1D, 2D, and 3D, and we compare the results against analytical solutions and a classical FEM solver. We show that variational loss performs comparably to energy-based loss and outperforms residual-based loss. Furthermore, the multi-level strategy significantly improves training robustness and efficiency, while the combined rh-adaptivity further enhances solution accuracy compared to fixed and purely r-adaptive meshes.},

By relying on a tensor decomposition, the proposed method addresses the curse of dimensionality in parametric computations, enabling efficient handling of high-dimensional problems across multiple physics and configurations. Each mode in the tensor decomposition is generated by a sparse neural network within the HiDeNN framework, with an element-based approach presented in Part I, where network parameters are constrained to replicate the classical shape functions used in the Finite Element Method. This constraint enhances the interpretability of the model, facilitating transfer learning, which improves significantly the robustness and cost of the training process. As shown in Part I, the HiDeNN framework can be leveraged to find the optimal spatial and parametric discretisation dynamically during training, which accounts to optimising the network’s architecture on the fly. This hybrid framework offers a flexible and interpretable solution for real-time surrogate modelling. We highlight the efficiency of the proposed neural Network-PGD (NN-PGD) approach through 1D, 2D and 3D benchmark problems, validating its performance against analytical and numerical reference solutions. The framework is illustrated through linear and non-linear elasticity problems, showing the flexibility of the method in terms of changes in physics.},

The deployment of such models in clinical settings has been limited however, due to the excessive computational costs incurred when performing mechanical simulations using conventional numerical solvers. An alternative approach to obtaining results in clinically relevant time frames is to make use of a computationally efficient surrogate model, called an emulator, in place of the numerical simulator. In this work, we propose an emulation framework for soft-tissue mechanics which builds on traditional approaches in two ways. Firstly, we use a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to perform emulation. GNNs can naturally handle the unique soft-tissue geometry of a given patient, without requiring any low-order approximations to be made. Secondly, the emulator is trained in a physics-informed manner to minimise a potential energy functional, meaning that no costly numerical simulations are required for training. We present results showing that our framework allows for highly accurate emulation for a range of soft-tissue mechanical models, while making predictions several orders of magnitude more quickly than the simulator.},

Although high-resolution flood simulations have made notable advancements, they remain computationally expensive, underscoring the need for efficient machine learning surrogate models. As a result of sparse empirical observation and expensive data collection, there is a growing need for the models to perform effectively in `small-data' contexts, a characteristic typical of many scientific problems. This research combines the latest developments in surrogate modelling and physics-informed machine learning to propose a novel Physics-Informed Neural Network-based surrogate model for hydrodynamic simulators governed by Shallow Water Equations. The proposed method incorporates physics-based prior information into the neural network structure by encoding the conservation of mass into the model without relying on calculating continuous derivatives in the loss function. The method is demonstrated for a high-resolution inland flood simulation model and a large-scale regional tidal model. The proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art data-driven approaches by up to 25~\%. This research demonstrates the benefits and robustness of physics-informed approaches in surrogate modelling for flood and hydroclimatic modelling problems.},

  abstract = {While deep learning and data-driven modeling approaches based on deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently attracted increasing attention for solving partial differential equations, their practical applications to real-world scientific and engineering problems remain limited due to the relatively low accuracy and high computational costs. In this study, we present a differentiable programming-based hybrid meshfree approach within the field of computational mechanics. This approach seamlessly integrates neural network-based deep learning architectures with physics-based meshfree discretization techniques, thus referred to as the neural-integrated meshfree (NIM) method. To effectively approximate the solution, NIM employs a hybrid scheme called NeuroPU approximation, which combines continuous DNN representations with partition of unity (PU) basis functions associated with the underlying spatial discretization. This neural-numerical hybridization not only enhances the solution representation through functional space decomposition but also reduces both the size of DNN model and the need of automatic differentiation for spatial gradient computations, leading to a significant improvement in training efficiency. Under the NIM framework, we propose two truly meshfree solvers: the strong form-based NIM (S-NIM) and the local variational form-based NIM (V-NIM). In the S-NIM solver, the strong-form governing equation is directly considered in the loss function, while the V-NIM solver employs a local Petrov--Galerkin approach that allows the construction of variational residuals based on arbitrary overlapping subdomains. This ensures both the satisfaction of underlying physics and the preservation of the meshfree property. We perform extensive numerical experiments on both stationary and transient benchmark problems to assess the effectiveness of the proposed NIM methods in terms of accuracy, scalability, generalizability, and convergence properties. Moreover, comparative analysis with other physics-informed machine learning methods demonstrates that NIM, especially V-NIM, significantly enhances both accuracy and efficiency in end-to-end predictive capabilities.},

In this paper we offer a new paradigm for computing high fidelity implicit neural representations directly from raw data (i.e., point clouds, with or without normal information). We observe that a rather simple loss function, encouraging the neural network to vanish on the input point cloud and to have a unit norm gradient, possesses an implicit geometric regularization property that favors smooth and natural zero level set surfaces, avoiding bad zero-loss solutions. We provide a theoretical analysis of this property for the linear case, and show that, in practice, our method leads to state of the art implicit neural representations with higher level-of-details and fidelity compared to previous methods.},

While common PINN algorithms are based on training one deep neural network (DNN), we propose a multi-network model that results in more accurate representation of the field variables. To validate the model, we test the framework on synthetic data generated from analytical and numerical reference solutions. We study convergence of the PINN model, and show that Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) results in superior accuracy and convergence characteristics compared with classic low-order Finite Element Method (FEM). We also show the applicability of the framework for transfer learning, and find vastly accelerated convergence during network re-training. Finally, we find that honoring the physics leads to improved robustness: when trained only on a few parameters, we find that the PINN model can accurately predict the solution for a wide range of parameters new to the network---thus pointing to an important application of this framework to sensitivity analysis and surrogate modeling.},

A POD-Galerkin PINN ROM is then derived by introducing deep neural networks which approximate the reduced outputs with the input being time and/or parameters of the model. The neural networks incorporate the physical equations (the POD-Galerkin reduced equations) into their structure as part of the loss function. Using this approach, the reduced model is able to approximate unknown parameters such as physical constants or the boundary conditions. A demonstration of the applicability of the proposed ROM is illustrated by three cases which are the steady flow around a backward step, the flow around a circular cylinder and the unsteady turbulent flow around a surface mounted cubic obstacle.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

The polynomial model form of Operator Inference is sufficiently expressive to cover a wide range of nonlinear dynamics found in fluid mechanics and other fields of science and engineering, while still providing efficient reduced model computations. The learning steps of Operator Inference are rooted in classical projection-based model reduction; thus, some of the rich theory of model reduction can be applied to models learned with Operator Inference. This connection to projection-based model reduction theory offers a pathway toward deriving error estimates and gaining insights to improve predictions. Furthermore, through formulations of Operator Inference that preserve Hamiltonian and other structures, important physical properties such as energy conservation can be guaranteed in the predictions of the reduced model beyond the training horizon. This review illustrates key computational steps of Operator Inference through a large-scale combustion example.},

This paper presents a framework of the nonlinear finite element based on HiDeNN approximation (nonlinear HiDeNN-FEM). This is enabled by three basic building blocks employing structured deep neural networks: (1) A partial derivative operator block that performs the differentiation of the shape functions with respect to the element coordinates, (2) An r-adaptivity block that improves the local and global convergence properties and (3) A materials derivative block that evaluates the material derivatives of the shape function. While these building blocks can be applied to any element, specific implementations are presented in 1D and 2D to illustrate the application of the deep learning neural network. Two-step optimization schemes are further developed to allow for the capabilities of r-adaptivity and easy integration with any existing FE solver. Numerical examples of 2D and 3D demonstrate that the proposed nonlinear HiDeNN-FEM with r-adaptivity provides much higher accuracy than regular FEM. It also significantly reduces element distortion and suppresses the hourglass mode.},

Our numerical tests indicate that the L-BFGS method is faster than the method of Buckley and LeNir, and is better able to use additional storage to accelerate convergence. We show that the L-BFGS method can be greatly accelerated by means of a simple scaling. We then compare the L-BFGS method with the partitioned quasi-Newton method of Griewank and Toint (1982a). The results show that, for some problems, the partitioned quasi-Newton method is clearly superior to the L-BFGS method. However we find that for other problems the L-BFGS method is very competitive due to its low iteration cost. We also study the convergence properties of the L-BFGS method, and prove global convergence on uniformly convex problems. {\copyright} 1989 North-Holland.},

One example concerns the optimization and inverse identification problems encountered in welding processes.

Contrary to conventional tensor decomposition methods, based on full grids (eg, parallel factor analysis/higher-order singular value decomposition), the proposed method is adapted to sparse grids, which allows an efficient adaptive sampling in the multidimensional parameter space. In addition, a residual-based accelerator is proposed to accelerate the higher-order proper generalized decomposition procedure for the optimal aspect of computational vademecum. Based on a simplified welding model, different examples of computational vademecum of dimension up to 6, taking into account both geometry and material parameters, are presented. These vademecums lead to real-time parametric solutions and can serve as handbook for engineers to deal with optimization, identification, or other problems related to repetitive task.},

  abstract = {Comprehensive image-based computational modeling pipelines are being actively developed for high-fidelity patient-specific cardiac simulations. However, conventional simulation techniques pose a challenge in this regard, primarily because of their excessively slow performance. We have developed a Neural Network Finite Element (NNFE) approach for high-speed cardiac mechanics simulations that can produce accurate simulation results within seconds (Journal of Biomechanical Engineering 144.12 (2022): 121010.). The method utilized neural networks to learn the displacement solution; and finite elements for defining the problem domain, specifying the boundary conditions, and performing numerical integrations. The NNFE method does not rely on use of traditional FEM simulations, experimental data, or reduced order modeling approaches, and has been successfully applied to hyperelastic boundary value problems using a potential energy formulation. In the present work we extended the NNFE approach to a prolate spheroid model of the left ventricle as a starting point for more complex cardiac simulations. We incorporated spatially varying fiber structures and utilized a Fung-type material model that included active contraction along the local myofiber axis. As cardiac mechanics are non-conservative problems with path-dependent pressure boundary conditions, we developed a new NNFE formulation based on classical virtual work principles. Importantly, the resultant NNFE cardiac model was trained over the complete physiological functional range of pressure, volume, and myofiber active stress. The final trained cardiac model predicted the displacement solution over the cardiac cycle for any physiological condition without retraining with a mean nodal displacement error of 0.023{\textpm}0.019mm. Similar agreement accuracy was found for the stress and strain results. The NNFE model trained within 2.25 h and predicted the complete pressure--volume response within 30 s, whereas the FE model took approximately 5 h. This study successfully demonstrates the potential of the NNFE method to simulate cardiac mechanics with high speed and accuracy over the complete physiological functional space.},

The targeted problems are three-dimensional structures driven by Chaboche-type elastic-viscoplastic constitutive laws. In this context, parametric analysis can lead to highly expensive computations when using a direct treatment. As an alternative, we present a technique based on the use of the time-space proper generalized decomposition in the framework of the LATIN method. To speed up the calculations in the parametrized context, we use the fact that at each iteration of the LATIN method, an approximation over the entire time-space domain is available. Then, a global reduced-order basis is generated, reused and eventually enriched, by treating, one-by-one, all the various parameter sets. The novelty of the current paper is to develop a strategy that uses the reduced-order basis for any new set of parameters as an initialization for the iterative procedure. The reduced-order basis, which has been built for a set of parameters, is reused to build a first approximation of the solution for another set of parameters. An error indicator allows adding new functions to the basis only if necessary. The gain of this strategy for studying the influence of material or loading variability reaches the order of 25 in the industrial examples that are presented.

  abstract = {Over the past years, model reduction techniques have become a necessary path for the reduction of computational requirements in the numerical simulation of complex models. A family of a priori model reduction techniques, called Proper Generalized Decomposition (PGD) methods, are receiving a growing interest. These methods rely on the a priori construction of separated variables representations of the solution of models defined in tensor product spaces. They can be interpreted as generalizations of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) for the a priori construction of such separated representations. In this paper, we introduce and study different definitions of PGD for the solution of time-dependent partial differential equations. We review classical definitions of PGD based on Galerkin or Minimal Residual formulations and we propose and discuss several improvements for these classical definitions. We give an interpretation of optimal decompositions as the solution of pseudo-eigenproblems. We also introduce a new definition of PGD, called Minimax PGD, which can be interpreted as a Petrov--Galerkin model reduction technique, where test and trial reduced basis functions are related by an adjoint problem. This new definition improves convergence properties of separated representations with respect to a chosen metric. It coincides with a classical POD for degenerate time-dependent partial differential equations. For the numerical construction of each PGD, we propose algorithms inspired from the solution of eigenproblems. Several numerical examples illustrate and compare the different definitions of PGD on transient advection--diffusion--reaction equations.},

  abstract = {We propose the Convolution Hierarchical Deep-learning Neural Network (C-HiDeNN) that can be tuned to have superior accuracy, higher smoothness, and faster convergence rates like higher order finite element methods (FEM) while using only linear element's degrees of freedom. This is based on our newly developed convolution interpolation theory (Lu et al. in Comput Mech, 2023) and this article focuses on the deep-learning interpretation of C-HiDeNN with graphics processing unit (GPU) programming using JAX library in Python. Instead of increasing the degrees of freedom like higher order FEM, C-HiDeNN takes advantage of neighboring elements to construct the so-called convolution patch functions. The computational overhead of C-HiDeNN is reduced by GPU programming and the total solution time is brought down to the same order as commercial FEM software running on a CPU, however, with orders of magnitude better accuracy and faster convergence rates. C-HiDeNN is locking-free regardless of element types (even with 3-node triangular elements or 4-node tetrahedral elements). C-HiDeNN is also capable of r-h-p-mesh adaptivity like its predecessor HiDeNN (Zhang et al. in Comput Mech 67:207--230, 2021) with additional ``a'' (dilation parameter) adaptivity that stems from the convolution patch function and ``p'' adaptivity with higher accuracy and with the same degrees of freedom as that of the linear finite elements. C-HiDeNN potentially has myriad future applications in multiscale analysis, additive and advanced manufacturing process simulations, and high-resolution topology optimization. Details on these applications can be found in the companion papers (Lu et al. 2023; Saha et al. in Comput Mech, 2023; Li et al. in Comput Mech, 2023) published in this special issue.},

  abstract = {Pulmonary function is tightly linked to the lung mechanical behavior, especially large deformation during breathing. Interstitial lung diseases, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), have an impact on the pulmonary mechanics and consequently alter lung function. However, IPF remains poorly understood, poorly diagnosed, and poorly treated. Currently, the mechanical impact of such diseases is assessed by pressure--volume curves, giving only global information. We developed a poromechanical model of the lung that can be personalized to a patient based on routine clinical data. The personalization pipeline uses clinical data, mainly computed tomography (CT) images at two time steps and involves the formulation of an inverse problem to estimate regional compliances. The estimation problem can be formulated both in terms of ``effective'', i.e., without considering the mixture porosity, or ``rescaled,'' i.e., where the first-order effect of the porosity has been taken into account, compliances. Regional compliances are estimated for one control subject and three IPF patients, allowing to quantify the IPF-induced tissue stiffening. This personalized model could be used in the clinic as an objective and quantitative tool for IPF diagnosis.},

In this work, we present our developments in the context of solving two main classes of problems: data-driven solution and data-driven discovery of partial differential equations. Depending on the nature and arrangement of the available data, we devise two distinct types of algorithms, namely continuous time and discrete time models. The first type of models forms a new family of data-efficient spatio-temporal function approximators, while the latter type allows the use of arbitrarily accurate implicit Runge--Kutta time stepping schemes with unlimited number of stages. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through a collection of classical problems in fluids, quantum mechanics, reaction--diffusion systems, and the propagation of nonlinear shallow-water waves.},

All the data must be taken into account to find the basis vectors. These methods are not convenient for any improvement of the basis vectors when new data are added into the data base. We consider the data as a state evolution and we propose an incremental algorithm to build basis functions for the decomposition of this state evolution. The proposed algorithm is based on the APHR method (A Priori Hyper-Reduction method). This is an adaptive strategy to build reduced order model when the state evolution is implicitely defined by non-linear governing equations. In case of known state evolutions the APHR method is an incremental Karhunen-Lo{\`e}ve decomposition. This approach is very convenient to expand the subspace spanned by the basis functions. In the first part of the present paper the main concepts related to the ``a priori'' model reduction technique are revisited, as a previous task to its application in the cases considered in the next sections.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a tensor decomposition (TD) based reduced-order model of the hierarchical deep-learning neural networks (HiDeNN). The proposed HiDeNN-TD method keeps advantages of both HiDeNN and TD methods. The automatic mesh adaptivity makes the HiDeNN-TD more accurate than the finite element method (FEM) and conventional proper generalized decomposition (PGD) and TD, using a fraction of the FEM degrees of freedom. This work focuses on the theoretical foundation of the method. Hence, the accuracy and convergence of the method have been studied theoretically and numerically, with a comparison to different methods, including FEM, PGD, TD, HiDeNN and Deep Neural Networks. In addition, we have theoretically shown that the PGD/TD converges to FEM at increasing modes, and the PGD/TD solution error is a summation of the mesh discretization error and the mode reduction error. The proposed HiDeNN-TD shows a high accuracy with orders of magnitude fewer degrees of freedom than FEM, and hence a high potential to achieve fast computations with a high level of accuracy for large-size engineering and scientific problems. As a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, we propose a highly efficient solution strategy called HiDeNN-PGD. Although the solution is less accurate than HiDeNN-TD, HiDeNN-PGD still provides a higher accuracy than PGD/TD and FEM with only a small amount of additional cost to PGD.},

  abstract = {The hierarchical deep-learning neural network (HiDeNN) is systematically developed through the construction of structured deep neural networks (DNNs) in a hierarchical manner, and a special case of HiDeNN for representing Finite Element Method (or HiDeNN-FEM in short) is established. In HiDeNN-FEM, weights and biases are functions of the nodal positions, hence the training process in HiDeNN-FEM includes the optimization of the nodal coordinates. This is the spirit of r-adaptivity, and it increases both the local and global accuracy of the interpolants. By fixing the number of hidden layers and increasing the number of neurons by training the DNNs, rh-adaptivity can be achieved, which leads to further improvement of the accuracy for the solutions. The generalization of rational functions is achieved by the development of three fundamental building blocks of constructing deep hierarchical neural networks. The three building blocks are linear functions, multiplication, and inversion. With these building blocks, the class of deep learning interpolation functions are demonstrated for interpolation theories such as Lagrange polynomials, NURBS, isogeometric, reproducing kernel particle method, and others. In HiDeNN-FEM, enrichment functions through the multiplication of neurons is equivalent to the enrichment in standard finite element methods, that is, generalized, extended, and partition of unity finite element methods. Numerical examples performed by HiDeNN-FEM exhibit reduced approximation error compared with the standard FEM. Finally, an outlook for the generalized HiDeNN to high-order continuity for multiple dimensions and topology optimizations are illustrated through the hierarchy of the proposed DNNs.},

Interestingly, AR technology has only been sparsely used in scientific visualization.

To ease access to AR for the scientific community, we introduce a novel visualization pipeline with which they can create and render AR models. We demonstrate our pipeline by means of finite element results, but note that our pipeline is generally applicable to data that may be represented through meshed surfaces. Specifically, we use two open-source software packages, ParaView and Blender. The models are then rendered through the ¡model-viewer¿ platform, which we access through Android and iOS smartphones. To demonstrate our pipeline, we build AR models from static and time-series results of finite element simulations discretized with continuum, shell, and beam elements. Moreover, we openly provide python scripts to automate this process. Thus, others may use our framework to create and render AR models for their own research and teaching activities.},

By relying on a tensor decomposition, the proposed method addresses the curse of dimensionality in parametric computations, enabling efficient handling of high-dimensional problems across multiple physics and configurations. Each mode in the tensor decomposition is generated by a sparse neural network within the Finite Element Neural Network Interpolation (FENNI) framework presented in Part I, where network parameters are constrained to replicate the classical shape functions used in the Finite Element Method. This constraint enhances the interpretability of the model, facilitating transfer learning, which improves significantly the robustness and cost of the training process. The FENNI framework also enables finding the optimal spatial and parametric discretisation dynamically during training, which accounts to optimising the model's architecture on the fly. This hybrid framework offers a flexible and interpretable solution for real-time surrogate modelling. We highlight the efficiency of the FENNI-PGD approach through 1D and 2D benchmark problems, validating its performance against analytical and numerical reference solutions. The framework is illustrated through linear and non-linear elasticity problems, showing the flexibility of the method in terms of changes in physics.},

  abstract = {We present the Finite Element Neural Network Interpolation (FENNI) framework, a sparse neural network architecture extending previous work on Embedded Finite Element Neural Networks (EFENN) introduced with the Hierarchical Deep-learning Neural Networks (HiDeNN). Due to their mesh-based structure, EFENN requires significantly fewer trainable parameters than fully connected neural networks, with individual weights and biases having a clear interpretation. Our FENNI framework, within the EFENN framework, brings improvements to the HiDeNN approach. First, we propose a reference element-based architecture where shape functions are defined on a reference element, enabling variability in interpolation functions and straightforward use of Gaussian quadrature rules for evaluating the loss function. Second, we propose a pragmatic multigrid training strategy based on the framework's interpretability. Third, HiDeNN's combined rh-adaptivity is extended from 1D to 2D, with a new Jacobian-based criterion for adding nodes combining h- and r-adaptivity. From a deep learning perspective, adaptive mesh behavior through rh-adaptivity and the multigrid approach correspond to transfer learning, enabling FENNI to optimize the network's architecture dynamically during training. The framework's capabilities are demonstrated on 1D and 2D test cases, where its accuracy and computational cost are compared against an analytical solution and a classical FEM solver. On these cases, the multigrid training strategy drastically improves the training stage's efficiency and robustness. Finally, we introduce a variational loss within the EFENN framework, showing that it performs as well as energy-based losses and outperforms residual-based losses. This framework is extended to surrogate modeling over the parametric space in Part II.},
